# hello-world
Created to supplement the Flatiron Bootcamp Prep Tutorial Intro to Github challenge 

On this edit I want to wave hello and not just state it in text based english! 
Learning coding has sparked my imagination and calmed my nerves by giving a new stressful joy to explore! 
One day I want to build digital platforms that interact with humans on a daily basis to given us new tools that matter!

Have a great day,
Peace & Love
